# Welcome to the Repository of Team12 at iQuHACK 2021!
 Our goal is to implement a solver for the gam star battle / to not touch.

 Therefore we use the ocean sdk from dwavesys

 ## Usage

 `python starbattle.py <cells filepath>`

 The Cells filepath, is the field which should be solved. All Cells that belong to the same block share the same number. You can find an example at example_cells.txt
